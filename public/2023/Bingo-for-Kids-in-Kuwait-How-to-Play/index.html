Plus, it can be educational, too! Here are the basics of how to play:</p>
<p>The game is played with a regular deck of cards. Shuffle the deck and deal out all of the cards face down. Each player then turns over two cards. The player with the highest value card starts the game. Play passes to the left and each player must either play a card or draw one from the deck. If they cannot play, they must pick up another card from the deck. The Ace is high, followed by 2-10, Jack, Queen and King (low). The winner is the first player to get rid of all their cards.</p>
<p>If you want to make things a bit more complicated, you can add in special “bingo” cards like Blackjack (Aces are high). In this variation, players try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (Blackjack pays 3:2).</p>
<p>Here are some other variations on traditional Bingo that can be fun for kids:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Matching – Similar to regular bingo, but players have to match up symbols on their cards instead of simply getting 5 in a row.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Word Association – Players are given a list of words and must come up with something that connects them all (eg – dog, cat, bird, fish). The first player says “dog” and the next player says “cat” etc. When someone can’t think of anything else that connects the words on their card, they shout “Bingo!”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Board Games – Instead of using cards, use playing pieces or counters on a board game like Snakes and Ladders or Ludo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter which variation you choose to play, Bingo is always a fun way to spend some time with your family!</p>
