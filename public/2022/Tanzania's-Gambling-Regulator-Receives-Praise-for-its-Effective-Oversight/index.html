        <h1 id="Tanzania’s-Gambling-Regulator-Receives-Praise-for-its-Effective-Oversight"><a href="#Tanzania’s-Gambling-Regulator-Receives-Praise-for-its-Effective-Oversight" class="headerlink" title="Tanzania’s Gambling Regulator Receives Praise for its Effective Oversight"></a>Tanzania’s Gambling Regulator Receives Praise for its Effective Oversight</h1><p>The Tanzania gambling regulator has been praised for its effective oversight of the gaming industry in the country. The regulator has been effective in ensuring that licensed operators are in compliance with the law, and in shutting down unlicensed operations.</p>
<p>This has led to a healthy and well-regulated gaming industry in Tanzania, which is benefiting consumers and generating tax revenues for the government. The regulator has also taken steps to protect vulnerable members of society from gambling-related harm, by implementing strict responsible gambling measures.</p>
<p>All of this has led to the gambling regulator being recognised as one of the most effective in Africa. This is a great credit to the regulator, and shows that it is doing an excellent job in protecting consumers and ensuring a healthy and sustainable gaming industry.</p>
<h1 id="Tanzania-Tightens-Regulations-on-Internet-Gambling"><a href="#Tanzania-Tightens-Regulations-on-Internet-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Tanzania Tightens Regulations on Internet Gambling"></a>Tanzania Tightens Regulations on Internet Gambling</h1><p>In December 2017, the Tanzanian government amended its regulations on internet gambling in a bid to curb illegal gambling and protect consumers. The new regulations require all internet service providers (ISPs) in Tanzania to block access to gambling websites.</p>
<p>The amendment was made following a public outcry over the increasing number of online gambling cases involving Tanzanians. In one high-profile case, two brothers aged 10 and 12 lost over TZS 2 million (approximately USD 930) playing an online casino game.</p>
<p>The Tanzanian government has justified the amendment by arguing that it will protect consumers from the risks associated with online gambling, such as addiction, financial loss and fraud. ISPs are required to block access to all websites offering gambling services, including sports betting, casino games and lotteries.</p>
<p>The regulation has been met with mixed reactions. While some stakeholders have welcomed it as a positive step towards protecting consumers, others have criticised it as a regressive measure that will hamper economic growth and innovation.</p>
<p>Internet service providers are required to comply with the amendment by 31 December 2017.</p>
<h1 id="Tanzania-Working-to-Regulate-Illegal-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Tanzania-Working-to-Regulate-Illegal-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Tanzania Working to Regulate Illegal Online Gambling"></a>Tanzania Working to Regulate Illegal Online Gambling</h1><p>The Tanzanian government is taking steps to regulate illegal online gambling in the country. A task force has been created to investigate and shut down illegal gambling operations, and the government is working with internet service providers to block access to gambling websites.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a major problem in Tanzania, and the government is hoping that regulation will help to address the issue. Gambling is banned in Tanzania, but there are many unlicensed and unregulated gambling operations operating online. These operations often victimize unsuspecting players, who lose money on rigged games.</p>
<p>The task force will work with the police and other law enforcement agencies to track down and shut down illegal gambling sites. The government is also working with internet service providers to block access to these websites. This will make it more difficult for people in Tanzania to gamble online illegally.</p>
<p>The task force is expected to submit a report on its findings within the next few months. The government will then decide what additional steps need to be taken to address the issue of illegal online gambling in Tanzania.</p>
<h1 id="Tanzania-Cracks-Down-on-Unregulated-Internet-Gambling"><a href="#Tanzania-Cracks-Down-on-Unregulated-Internet-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Tanzania Cracks Down on Unregulated Internet Gambling"></a>Tanzania Cracks Down on Unregulated Internet Gambling</h1><p>Tanzania is the latest country to crackdown on unregulated internet gambling, with the government announcing a new online gambling bill this week.</p>
<p>The new bill targets international online gambling operators, who have been taking advantage of a lack of regulation in the country to offer their services to Tanzanian players.</p>
<p>Under the new bill, online gambling operators will need to apply for a license from the government, and will be subject to regular audits to ensure that they are meeting regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Players will also be required to provide proof of identity in order to play, in an effort to crack down on underage gambling.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Tanzania has cracked down on unregulated internet gambling. In 2017, the government passed legislation requiring all online gambling operators to obtain a license from the government.</p>
<p>However, this legislation was not effectively enforced, and as a result, many unlicensed operators continued to offer their services to Tanzanian players.</p>
<p>The new bill is an attempt by the government to properly enforce its regulations and protect players from unscrupulous operators.</p>
<h1 id="New-Regulations-For-Internet-Gambling-In-Tanzania"><a href="#New-Regulations-For-Internet-Gambling-In-Tanzania" class="headerlink" title="New Regulations For Internet Gambling In Tanzania"></a>New Regulations For Internet Gambling In Tanzania</h1><p>The Tanzanian Minister of Finance has just announced new regulations for Internet gambling in the country. The regulations will come into effect on 1st January, 2019.</p>
<p>According to the new regulations, only licensed operators will be allowed to offer gambling services in Tanzania. These licensed operators must comply with a number of strict conditions, including geo-blocking of Tanzanian citizens from accessing offshore gambling websites.</p>
<p>In addition, Tanzanian citizens will only be able to gamble with licensed domestic operators. This means that any Tanzanian who wants to gamble online will have to use an operator that is licensed in Tanzania.</p>
<p>These new regulations are designed to protect Tanzanian consumers and ensure that only reputable operators are offering gambling services in the country. The Minister of Finance said that the government is committed to creating a safe and fair environment for online gambling in Tanzania.</p>
<p>Tanzanian consumers have responded positively to the news of the new regulations. One consumer said that she is glad to see the government taking action against unlicensed operators. She added that she looks forward to using a domestic operator that is licensed and regulated by the government.</p>
