        <h1 id="Nevada-casinos-require-tax-forms-documenting-gambling-losses"><a href="#Nevada-casinos-require-tax-forms-documenting-gambling-losses" class="headerlink" title="Nevada casinos require tax forms documenting gambling losses"></a>Nevada casinos require tax forms documenting gambling losses</h1><p>Nevada casinos are cracking down on people who try to write off their gambling losses on their income taxes. The state’s Division of Gaming is requiring all casino patrons to fill out a tax form documenting their losses, which will then be provided to the IRS.</p>
<p>The new policy was implemented in an effort to cut down on tax evasion, as casino gambling is a popular way for people to hide their income from the government. “The Nevada gaming industry has long been a leader in ensuring that gaming is conducted fairly and openly, and we are committed to working with our regulators and the IRS to ensure that all players are reporting their gaming activities,” said Gaming Commission Chairman Tony Alamo Jr.</p>
<p>Casino officials say that the forms will be used solely for tax purposes, and will not be shared with the casinos themselves. They also note that the forms are not mandatory, and that players can choose whether or not to fill them out.</p>
<p>Those who do choose to fill out the forms will have to provide their name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. They will also have to list their total winnings and losses for the year, as well as how much money they deposited at the casino.</p>
<p>Some gamblers are unhappy with the new policy, arguing that it violates their privacy rights. But others say that it’s reasonable for casinos to require such documentation in order to prevent tax evasion.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-casinos-to-begin-requiring-documentation-of-gambling-losses"><a href="#Pennsylvania-casinos-to-begin-requiring-documentation-of-gambling-losses" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania casinos to begin requiring documentation of gambling losses"></a>Pennsylvania casinos to begin requiring documentation of gambling losses</h1><p>In Pennsylvania, some casinos will soon require patrons to provide documentation of their gambling losses in order to claim any winnings. This new policy, which is to take effect in mid-January, comes as a response to new legislation that was passed in October. The goal of the new law is to prevent people from fraudulently claiming gambling losses in order to reduce their taxable income.</p>
<p>Casinos in the state have been struggling with unpaid taxes in recent years, and it is believed that this new measure will help to address that issue. In particular, it is hoped that the requirement for documentation of gambling losses will help to prevent people from falsely reporting their losses and thus avoiding paying taxes on their winnings.</p>
<p>Under the new law, casinos will be able to deny payouts to anyone who cannot provide documentation of their losses. This means that players will need to keep track of their gambling activity, including the amount they have lost and won, if they want to be able to collect any winnings.</p>
<p>The implementation of this policy has stirred up some controversy among casino players and advocates. Some people feel that it is an invasion of privacy, while others argue that it is simply unfair for casinos to require such documentation. Nonetheless, the policy is set to take effect next month, so players will need to be prepared for it.</p>
<h1 id="California-lawmakers-consider-legislation-toDocument-gambling-losses"><a href="#California-lawmakers-consider-legislation-toDocument-gambling-losses" class="headerlink" title="California lawmakers consider legislation toDocument gambling losses"></a>California lawmakers consider legislation toDocument gambling losses</h1><p>As state lawmakers across the U.S. continue to seek new ways to generate revenue, some are turning their attention to gambling losses as a potential source of tax income.</p>
<p>In California, Democratic Assemblyman Adam Gray is proposing a bill that would allow gamblers to write off their losses on their state income taxes. The proposed measure, AB351, was recently approved by the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee with a 7-0 vote.</p>
<p>“AB351 allows taxpayers in California to reduce their taxable income by the amount of gambling losses incurred during the year,” Gray said in a statement. “This common-sense proposal will help taxpayers recover some of the money they lose while gambling and create jobs in our local casinos.”</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would take effect on January 1, 2017. It would allow Californians to deduct up to $3,000 worth of gambling losses per year from their state taxable income.</p>
<p>Gray estimates that the bill could generate up to $150 million in new tax revenue for California each year. He also believes that it could create as many as 2,500 new jobs in the casino industry.</p>
<p>Similar proposals are being considered in other states across the U.S., including Iowa, Illinois and New York. In Iowa, Republican State Senator Randy Feenstra is proposing a bill that would allow Iowans to write off 50% of their gambling losses on their state income taxes. The proposed measure, SF2304, was recently approved by the Senate Ways and Means Committee with a 8-5 vote.</p>
<p>Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner has included a proposal to allow Illinois residents to deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income in his fiscal year 2018 budget plan. The proposed measure, SB1849, was introduced by State Senator Napoleon Harris III earlier this year. If passed, it would take effect on January 1, 2018.</p>
<p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is also considering a proposal that would allow New Yorkers to deduct their gambling losses from their state income taxes. The proposed measure, AB6161, was introduced by Assemblyman Gary Pretlow earlier this year.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Losses-to-be-documented-in-Illinois"><a href="#Gambling-Losses-to-be-documented-in-Illinois" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Losses to be documented in Illinois"></a>Gambling Losses to be documented in Illinois</h1><p>Today, Illinois governor Pat Quinn signed a bill into law that will require people who lose more than $500 gambling to document those losses. The new law is designed to help the state better understand the scope of gambling problems in Illinois and to help people address their gambling addictions.</p>
<p>sponsor</p>
<p>Under the law, people who lose more than $500 at any casino or other gambling venue within a 30-day period must report those losses to the state. They must also provide documentation such as receipts, betting tickets, and other records of their gambling activity.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem in Illinois. A 2008 study by the University of Chicago found that about 2 percent of Illinois residents had a serious gambling problem. That’s more than twice the national average.</p>
<p>The new law is part of a larger effort by the state to address its growing gambling addiction problem. In addition to requiring documentation of losses, the new law also creates a task force to study gambling addiction and makes grants available for treatment programs.</p>
<p>The new law takes effect on January 1, 2013.</p>
<h1 id="New-Hampshire-considers-allowing-tax-deduction-for-gambling-losses"><a href="#New-Hampshire-considers-allowing-tax-deduction-for-gambling-losses" class="headerlink" title="New Hampshire considers allowing tax deduction for gambling losses"></a>New Hampshire considers allowing tax deduction for gambling losses</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>A bill has been put forward in the New Hampshire House of Representatives that would allow taxpayers to deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income. If passed, the legislation would make New Hampshire the first state to enact such a measure.</p>
<p>The proposal, sponsored by Republican Representative Stephen Stepanek, is part of a broader package of tax reform measures aimed at stimulating economic growth in the state. Gambling proponents argue that the deduction would provide a much-needed financial boost to gamblers who have seen their profits slashed in recent years as casinos have proliferated.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill, however, argue that it would simply add to the state’s budget woes and do nothing to help those who are struggling financially. They also point out that gambling is known to be addictive and can lead to devastating consequences for those who lose control over their betting habits.</p>
<p>The fate of the proposed measure is uncertain, but if it does pass, it could provide a much-needed shot in the arm for New Hampshire’s ailing gambling industry.</p>
