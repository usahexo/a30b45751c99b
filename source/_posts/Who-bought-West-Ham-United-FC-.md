#  Who bought West Ham United FC? 

The sale of the football club West Ham United FC is shrouded in mystery. Who bought the club and for how much?

Rumors abound about the identity of the new owner of the English Premier League football club. The Sun reported that a consortium led by David Sullivan and David Gold, who also own Birmingham City FC, had agreed to purchase West Ham United FC from former Icelandic owners Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson and Eggert Magnusson for £100 million. The Times later reported that the sale price was actually £105 million.

However, Sullivan and Gold issued a statement denying that they were the new owners of West Ham United FC. They claimed that they were only interested in brokering a deal for the club and were not prepared to invest their own money.

Further confusion was caused when it was announced that CB Holding, an investment company controlled by media tycoon Kjartan Gardarsson, had purchased a 75% stake in the club for £50 million. However, Gardarsson later issued a statement denying that he was the new owner of West Ham United FC.

The true identity of the new owner of West Ham United FC remains a mystery.

#  What were the circumstances of the sale? 
In 1978, the Shah of Iran was overthrown in a popular revolution. Fearing for his life, he fled to Egypt and entered into negotiations with the new regime to sell his country's oil assets. 

The new Iranian government was opposed to the deal, as it would have given the Shah and his family a safe passage out of the country. They eventually agreed to the sale, but only on the condition that the Shah would not be allowed to use the money to fund his exile. 

Aftermath of the Revolution 

The fall of the Shah had a profound impact on Iran's economy. The new government quickly nationalized all of Iran's oil assets, which led to a dramatic decline in oil production. This, in turn, had a negative effect on Iran's economy and standard of living. 

The situation worsened in November 1980, when Iraqi forces invaded Iran and began a brutal eight-year war. The war caused massive damage to Iran's infrastructure and led to widespread shortages of food and other basic necessities.

#  Who are the current owners of the club? 

The current owners of the club are the Glazer family. The Glazer family is an American family that owns the Manchester United Football Club, as well as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). The family also has a controlling stake in First Allied Corporation, a company which owns and operates several shopping centers across the United States.

#  How much did the club sell for? 

In a move that shocks the footballing community, it was announced on Thursday that Barcelona have agreed to sell Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain in a deal worth €222 million.

The Brazilian has been a key player for the Catalan club since signing from Santos in 2013, scoring 105 goals in 186 appearances.

However, his future at the Camp Nou has been the subject of intense speculation in recent months and he has now decided to leave for the French capital.

The transfer fee is the most expensive ever paid for a player and it surpasses the €105 million PSG paid for Marco Reus in 2015.

Neymar's departure will be a huge blow to Barca, who will now have to find a replacement before the start of next season.

#  What are West Ham United FC's current fortunes on the pitch?

West Ham United FC are a professional football club who play their home games at the London Stadium in Stratford, East London. The club has had a mixed start to their Premier League campaign this season.

After enjoying an impressive 13th-place finish in the Premier League last season, manager Manuel Pellegrini was brought in to lead the charge and help the club push for a higher finish this time around. However, things have not gone according to plan for the Chilean so far - with his side currently occupying 10th place in the table, having won just four of their opening 12 fixtures.

One of the main reasons for their slow start has been their lack of goalscoring prowess - with only nine goals scored in those 12 games. This is in stark contrast to the 44 they netted last season and has seen them struggle to pick up wins against some of the division's lesser teams.

The Hammers do have some very talented players in their ranks, though, and will be confident of turning their fortunes around sooner rather than later. In attacking duo Felipe Anderson and Marko Arnautovic, they have two players who are more than capable of scoring goals and helping drag them up the table.

So, what are West Ham United FC's current fortunes on the pitch? In short - they are a side that are struggling to find consistency but do have some very talented individuals within their ranks. They will be hopeful of turning things around sooner rather than later and should be targeting a finish somewhere in the mid-table region come the end of the season.
