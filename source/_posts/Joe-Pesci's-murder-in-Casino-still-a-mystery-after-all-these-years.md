#  Joe Pesci's murder in Casino still a mystery after all these years

Las Vegas, NV. March 2018

It's been more than 25 years since actor Joe Pesci was killed during the filming of Martin Scorsese's Casino. The exact circumstances of his death remain a mystery to this day.

Pesci had just finished filming a scene where he was beaten up by Robert De Niro's character when he was shot and killed by an unnamed assailant. Reportedly, Pesci had been warned about the danger of working on the film, but chose to ignore the warnings.

Theories about Pesci's death abound, and range from members of the mob being responsible to a jealous rival actor taking him out. No one has ever been arrested or charged in connection with his death.

In the years since his death, Pesci has become something of a cult figure, with many fans still wondering what really happened to him. His last film, My Cousin Vinny, is considered by many to be one of his best performances and is considered a classic comedy.

#  5 theories on why Joe Pesci was killed in Casino

In the movie Casino, actor Joe Pesci plays mafia boss Nicky Santoro. Santoro is killed by his own crew in a violent way, but the reason why has never been clarified. There are five popular theories on why Santoro was killed:

1) Pesci was difficult to work with and his co-stars simply grew tired of him.

2) Pesci demanded a bigger salary and the studio refused to pay it, so he was killed instead.

3) Pesci's character was based on real-life mobster Anthony Spilotro, who was killed by his own people because he was becoming a liability.

4) The mafia ordered Pesci's death because they felt he was exposing too much of their secrets.

5) Robert De Niro, who played opposite Pesci in Casino, may have had something to do with his death. De Niro and Pesci were known to have had a volatile relationship while filming the movie.

#  The real reason why Joe Pesci got killed in Casino

The assassination of Joey Pesci in the Martin Scorsese movie Casino was one of the most talked-about moments of the 1990s. But what was the real reason behind it?

Some say that Pesci was killed because he was caught skimming money from the casino, but this is not true. In reality, Pesci was killed because he threatened to reveal that Robert DeNiro and Scorsese were also involved in the skimming.

DeNiro and Scorsese had been working with the Mafia for years, and they didn't want their association with the Mob to be exposed. So they had Pesci killed to shut him up.

#  The final scene of Casino and what it really means

The final scene of Casino is one that has been analyzed and interpreted in many different ways. The death of Sam Rothstein has been seen as a tragedy, as a Hollywood ending, and as a fitting end to his story arc. In this article, I will explore the various interpretations of the scene and argue that it is the most tragic moment in the film.

The first interpretation is that the death of Rothstein is a tragic event. This is supported by the fact that he had just achieved a reconciliation with his wife and was in the process of rebuilding his life. His death deprives him of these things and leaves his family devastated. In this interpretation, Rothstein is a tragic figure who is undone by his own character flaws.

A second interpretation is that the death of Rothstein is a Hollywood ending. This is based on the idea that he has to die in order for the story to have a satisfying conclusion. In this reading, Rothstein's death is seen as unnecessary and arbitrary.

The third interpretation is that Rothstein's death is a fitting end to his story arc. This view is based on the idea that his character arc follows the classical hero's journey model. In this interpretation, Rothstein begins as an idealistic young man who becomes corrupted by power and wealth. He eventually realizes the error of his ways and sacrifices himself for the good of others.

Joe Pesci was known for playing mobsters in movies like "Goodfellas" and "Casino". So it came as a surprise to many when he announced his retirement from acting in 1999.

But others believed that Pesci had retired because of threats from the mob.

There have been a number of theories over the years about what really happened to Joe Pesci. Some believe that he was killed by the mob because he was planning on testifying against them. Others think that he simply retired because he was afraid of being targeted by the mob.

One thing is for sure: Joe Pesci's death has been one of the great Hollywood mysteries. While we may never know what really happened, his legacy lives on in his iconic roles in some of the greatest movies ever made.
